Melbourne Ipsum
===============

a Sublime Text plugin for inserting hip filler text

<h3>props</h3>

Inspired by my love of the [Hipster Ipsum](https://github.com/phyllisstein/HipsterIpsum) plugin, and the code was ported from Leigh Hathaway's lovely [Melbourne Ipsum page](http://www.melbourneipsum.com.au).

Installation
------------

I strongly recommend you install via [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control). If you're comfortable with a manual install, you can clone this repo and go nuts.

Usage
-----

__via command palette__: search for 'Melbourne Ipsum'  
__via hotkeys__: OSX: [ctrl+option+m+i], Windows: [ctrl+alt+m+i]  
__via snippet__: s-o-m-e-l-b-n tab

I've done the bare minimum here. If you like the plugin, but it needs some polish, feel free to open up an issue. Or a pull request, even!
